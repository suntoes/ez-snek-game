## My first personal project, from zero.
Made this possible because a redditor recommended me some DOM documentation. From there I figured out that I kinda made a fool outta myself learning html, css, javascript & bits of react for the past 3 months without hearing about DOM first. Few days after that, exactly just when I've finished the introduction part of the documentation to DOM, I had got to coding right away, and this is the result of my recent code spree redemption.

## What I've learned from this is...
There are hella lot of real deal hefty documentation out there that I've got to read.
