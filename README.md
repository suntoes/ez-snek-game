### My first personal project, from zero.
Looking back exactly a week ago, I was so confident to code one like this after 2.5 months of messing around with the free course I took, but I've found myself devastated when I realized how hard it was. 

After some time, someone recommend me some documentation, and then I figured out that my learning path was a bit off. And that was going straight to react without learning proper DOM. 

Few days after, just when I've just finished the introduction part of the documentation to DOM, I had got to coding right away, and this is the result of my recent code spree redemption.

### What I've learned from this is...
There are hella lot of real deal hefty documentation out there that I've got to read.
